        <strong>DOMAIN NAME AND YOUR BROWSER</strong>
        <p>if you were asked as to what will happen when you enter the domain name in the address bar of a browser?
            an internet user will surely tell you that web-page of
            the site will appear but as a developer, you will be expected to analyze how the internet works behind the scene.
            The
            domain name made<u><em>iternet protocol (IP address)</em></u> simple to remember because is been replaced with
            letters
            human beings already familiar with instead of a numeric value (#.#.#.#). For instance, ipv4 or ipv6 is in 0 and
            1(#.#.#.#) it
            uniquely identifies the computer on the internet and that's what allows computers to talk to each other</p>
        <p>And before the advent of DHCP, you will need to get a technician to configure your device for you for it to be able
            to use internet services. However,
            the <u><em>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</em></u> now responsible for allocating IP address to computer
            automatically. This DHCP comes from
            the router or some kind of server so any time you on your computer and it will provide you with unique IP
        </p>
        <p>How does my computer know how to find the other IP addresses whenever I type in the www.exanple.com. DNS
            <u><em>(Domain Name System}</em></u>is the one responsible for converting
            the domain name into correspondence IP addresses so it facilitates this communication between computers
        </p>
        <p>TCP transmission control protocol...this is what will ensure that whatever an internet user requested/packet get to
            their intended destination.
            The language of the internet is HTTP <em>(hypertext transfer protocol)</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>As everything in life begins with a step so it is in programming, when the basis is solid and firm the structure on
            it will also stand the test of time. Take the steps with ambition, determination, and a can-do attitude to
            understand the basics as it will go a long way
            in making another technical aspect of the journey fall in place.
